# Movies App

We see a list of films received from the API on the main screen. In the right corner of the screen, there is a button, when clicked, we are allowed to sort films by four parameters: rating in ascending/descending order and release date in ascending/descending order.

A collection of buttons at the top of the screen sorts movies into categories.

When you click on the card of a specific movie, a screen opens with a detailed description of the movie, rating, year, etc.

Presents the implementation of adding movies to favorites. When you click on the heart, movies are added to your favorites and can be viewed on a separate "Favorites" screen.

Also implemented a separate screen with a search.
